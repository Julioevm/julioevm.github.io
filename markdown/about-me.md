# Hey there! üëã

I'm Julio, a tech enthusiast who's been in the industry for over 9 years now. My journey's taken me from helping folks with tech support to testing products, and these days I'm all about development.

## What I'm About

Tech (especially software development) is my jam! I'm constantly tinkering with new tools and approaches because, well, learning new stuff is fun.

My big thing is creating experiences that users actually enjoy. I firmly believe that:

Simpler is almost always better
The end user should be at the center of everything we build
It's better to ship something good and improve it than to chase perfection forever
Measuring results > adding complexity
When I'm not coding, you'll find me playing video games or reading (mostly sci-fi).

Let's connect and build something awesome together!
